## Introduction

For this project, I utilized my Time Series Analysis skills to forecast real estate prices of zipcodes using data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). 

## Objectives

The CEO of PoManns Capital Real Estate hired my consultancy to answer the following quesitons based on the Zillow Data data:

- <b>Question:</b> *What are the top 5 best zipcodes for PoManns Capital to invest in Houston, Texas?*

## The Project

Our project team used the OSEMN framework to help PoManns Capital  select the top 5 best zipcodes to invest in short to mid to long term periods.

* **Obtaining** Data - 

* * We used data from Zillow with data from all over the United States
* **Scrubbing** Data - 

* * We broke down the data by country, then by state, then by city, then by zip code
* **Exploring** Data - 

* * We did a time-series analysis to see which zip codes had trends, seasonality, and other features that may influence price.
* **Modeling** Data - 

* * We used a method to select the best features in predicting price

* * We trained the model on the entire dataset

* * We made forecasts to see which zip codes would yield better return on investments in the short to long term periods
* **Interpreting** Data - 

* * ***Short Term*** - We looked at the average Return on Investment.
* * * ROI from 05/01/2018 to 11/01/2018

* * ***Mid Term*** - We looked at the average Return on Investment.
* * * ROI from 05/01/2018 to 11/01/2019

* * ***Long Term*** - We looked at the average Return on Investment.
* * * ROI from 05/01/2018 to 11/02/2020

## The Results

Our model predicts a decline in price across all zip codes in Houston. The decline can vary between short to long term period, but the pricing difference can range between zip codes.

Our results are below:

- <b>Question:</b> *What are the top 5 best zipcodes for PoManns Capital to invest in Houston, Texas?*

* 77028 
* 77033
* 77029
* 77051
* 77078

* At the low end, your company's investments in 77028 can lose about $1,800 short term, $2,000 mid-term to long-term. 

* At the high end, your company's investments in 77078 can lose about $19 - $20,000 short to long term. 

We recommend investing in these 5 minimum loss zip codes, which also have the most cost effecient housing prices on average, in comparison to all other zip codes in Houston, Texas.
