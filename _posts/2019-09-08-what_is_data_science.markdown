If you did not know, we are transitioning from the information age to the creative age due to the pure amount of information available and the exponential amount of information being created. I assume you have already heard of the term "Big data". When dealing with big data, companies usually have big problems and customers or investors may wonder why this happened, or why that is happening. With so many web servers, databases, APIs, etc., where do we start? 

In this post, I will: 
1. Answer the question, "What is data science?"
2. Provide more data behind the science
3. Share average salary and jobs in data science   

I started on my data science journey in June 2019, after an introduction to machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligence via the autonomous car movement.  After one month of school, we have covered and practiced data cleaning and transformation, as well as exploratory data analysis and visualization. Over the next few months I am learning more about databases, data modeling and machine learning algorithims! So...


**What is Data Science?**

Data science is the study of data. It involves developing methods of recording, storing, and analyzing data to effectively extract useful information. The goal of data science is to gain insights and knowledge from any type of data — both structured and unstructured. - [TechTerms](https://techterms.com/definition/data_science)

**More Data Behind the Science**

The term “data scientist” was coined as recently as 2008 when companies realized the need for data professionals who are skilled in organizing and analyzing massive amounts of data. - [Berkeley](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/about/what-is-data-science/)

*Applications of Data Science:*
* Products recommendations based on multiple variables
* Correlations between genomic data and genetic issues
* Logistic companies analyzing routes to ship 
* Identifying fraud in financial transactions
* Predicting airline flight delays
* and many more...

*Why become a Data Scientist:*

1. 'cause Data Scientists ranked as the #1 Best Job in America for the past three years on Glassdoor
2. 'cause IBM Predicts Demand For Data Scientists Will Soar 28% By 2020
3. 'cause the advertised data jobs pay an average salary range of $95k - $165k 
4.  'cause Data Scientists use data to create impact and solve business problems


**Average Salary and Jobs!**

* Data analyst: $65,470
* Data scientist: $120,931
* Senior data scientist: $141,257
* Data engineer: $137,776

I hope this article was helpful! I will be blogging while I get through the Flatiron School's part-time online program for Data Science. If you're interested in learning more, you should definitely check out their prep-course.
